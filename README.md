👋 Hi, I’m @javidrahimli0, I'm from Azerbaijan and study at ELTE University.
👀 I’m interested in working with Datas, besides coding and solving tasks.
🌱 I’m currently learning C#, C, Clean Functional Programming, and the Basics of Bash language. My main focus for the near future is to begin ML and Data Science and deeply learn them.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with intermediate programmers on this platform. Additionally, work on projects with a team, mainly problem-solving and additional improvements.
